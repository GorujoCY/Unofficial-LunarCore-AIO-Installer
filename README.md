**Warning:** if you choose to uninstall/remove it, **everything** is removed so backup if you want. The community can explain the backup process for you I'm sure.
# How to use it
Very simply install the [executable](https://github.com/GorujoCY/Unofficial-LunarCore-AIO-Installer/releases/), from there everything is provided in before and after install text, no further explaination is needed.
# Install from Source?
Unfortunately the way Inno setup compiling works is that files get compressed then the installer gets compiled, so by the time you get to have the files you have a fully installed LunarCore and you must posses enough knowledge to install the client and component seperately. 

However per suggestion of member @kostas214 I've made a [batch file](https://github.com/GorujoCY/Unofficial-LunarCore-AIO-Installer/blob/main/LCfromSource.bat) that automatically fetches the latest LunarCore, all from source with me not needing to update it every so months with updates, you can just install the batch itself and it'll handle the rest with some user input.
